# Assets Folder

This folder is for storing images and other static assets.

## How to Add Images

1. **For Landing Page:**
   - Add `jaisirlogo.png` (logo image)
   - Add `shadow-image.jpeg` (background shadow image)

2. **For Vision Page:**
   - The logo will use `jaisirlogo.png` from above

## Image Guidelines

- Use optimized images (compressed)
- Recommended formats: PNG for logos, JPEG for photos
- Keep file sizes reasonable for web performance

## Current Images Needed

- `jaisirlogo.png` - JPR Logo (recommended size: 512x512px or larger)
- `shadow-image.jpeg` - Background image (recommended: 800x1200px or larger)

After adding images, they can be imported in components like:
```tsx
import jprLogo from "@/assets/jaisirlogo.png";
```
